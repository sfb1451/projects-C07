abstract: Using real-time measurements of preceding urge phenomena combined with high-density
  EEG recordings and thalamic local field potentials, the role of motor control on
  impulsive urges to move (and vice-versa) will be analysed. Involvement of thalamo-cortical
  loops in gating of sensorimotor interaction and initiation of motor action is scrutinised
  by modulation through deep brain stimulation and analyses of structural connectomics.
  By characterising the spatial and temporal dynamics of urged and cued motor initiation,
  this project aims at deciphering the neural processes underlying impulsive motor
  behaviour and sensorimotor gating.
